# Roadmap

Future product and architecture ideas from the handoff, separated from current implementation tasks.

## Infrastructure And Execution Model

PsiLabs should grow infrastructure in phases while preserving the current local-first architecture. The frontend remains Vite + React, Google Sheets and CSV remain the durable full archive, and Supabase remains a lightweight cloud summary layer for auth, permissions, session summaries, scoreboards, and other cloud UX where useful.

### Current Framework Checkpoint

Do not migrate PsiLabs to Next.js yet. Continue with Vite + React on Vercel until server-backed framework features become active requirements. Use Supabase for realtime/database needs, and keep app logic portable in `src/lib`, `src/hooks`, and `src/components`.

Re-evaluate Next.js when one or more of these become central implementation targets:

- Backend API routes inside the app.
- Server-mediated shared room links.
- Server-side short link generation.
- Server-side secrets or protected RNG / QRNG provider credentials.
- Auth-heavy private dashboards or auth as a core user experience.
- Stripe subscriptions or webhook handling.
- AI, speech-to-text, audio, video, or OpenCV processing through external APIs.
- Public SEO-heavy protocol, result, research, or docs pages.
- Dynamic share/result pages that need server-rendered metadata.

### Phase 1 - Local-First Protocol Engine

- Vite + React frontend.
- Supabase is optional and stores session summaries only.
- IndexedDB stores in-progress solo sessions and completed trial records locally as trials finish.
- Google Sheets + CSV are the primary archive for full trial history.
- Row Level Security is the primary security layer for Supabase data.
- No backend server is required for core local usage.

### Phase 2 - Controlled Cloud Logic

- Introduce Supabase Edge Functions or serverless functions only where client-side execution is not appropriate.
- Use cloud functions for secure validation, aggregation jobs, and RNG providers.
- Keep RNG providers server-side only when they require protected credentials or security-sensitive logic.
- Cloud logic remains optional and must not block local usage.

### Phase 3 - Intelligence Layer

- Introduce AI-assisted processing such as speech-to-text, structured analysis, or review workflows.
- Use server-side execution for external API calls and protected logic.
- Keep vendor choices abstract until a concrete implementation is required.
- Preserve local-first capture and archive paths even when intelligence features are unavailable.

### Phase 4 - Unified App Layer (Optional)

- Introduce a framework like Next.js only if the app needs a unified frontend and server logic layer.
- Deploy the unified app layer on Vercel.
- Keep Supabase as the data layer rather than replacing it.
- Preserve compatibility with existing schema fields, Google Sheets archives, and CSV exports.

### Design Principles

- Local-first by default.
- Supabase is not the permanent archive.
- Backend logic is introduced only when required.
- Avoid premature infrastructure complexity.
- Preserve compatibility with the existing schema and Sheets archive.

### Local-First Architecture & Storage Mode Detection

PsiLabs should support both lightweight web users and heavier desktop instrumentation users through a shared app model with environment-aware storage behavior.

Storage mode detection:

- Detect whether the app is running in a browser or desktop shell, such as a Windows app exposing `window.__PSILABS_DESKTOP__`.
- Set a shared `storageMode` value of `web` or `desktop`.
- Use `storageMode` to select storage, sync, backup prompts, and feature availability across the app.

Web-only mode:

- Default storage: IndexedDB and browser storage for in-progress session recovery, local history, preferences, and offline queues.
- Completed solo trials are appended to IndexedDB immediately after trial finalization; React state remains the active UI layer.
- Recommended persistence: Google Sheets sync for user-owned backup and cross-device access.
- Optional future persistence: Supabase or cloud account sync for dashboards, scoreboards, and shared sessions.
- UX should encourage users to connect Google Sheets or export data when they want durable backup outside the browser.

Desktop mode:

- Default storage: a local user directory using SQLite, CSV, or both.
- Save all sessions locally first, with offline-first behavior as the baseline.
- Optional sync can upload session summaries to a cloud/web dashboard without making cloud storage the raw-data authority.
- UX should emphasize user ownership of raw data, local control, and clear file locations.

Sync strategy:

- Write locally first in all modes, especially desktop.
- Sync periodically or at the end of sessions instead of treating the cloud as the primary write path.
- Support sync tiers: local only, summary sync, full private sync later, and public stats sharing later.
- Keep failed sync recoverable through retry queues and clear "pending sync" states.

Architectural intent:

- Web app: access layer for lightweight use, dashboards, sharing, social flows, and cross-device review.
- Desktop app: instrumentation layer for Whisper, OpenCV, sensor workflows, raw data capture, and heavier local processing.
- Avoid forcing heavy processing, large video/audio data, or sensitive raw experimental artifacts through the browser when a desktop path is more appropriate.

Future extensions:

- Local Whisper processing in desktop mode only.
- OpenCV and sensor-based experiments.
- Multi-device sync between desktop and web.
- User-selectable data privacy levels for local-only, private sync, and public sharing workflows.

## Product North Star

PsiLabs is a flexible experiment engine for structured, repeatable protocols around unusual human claims.

Mindsight is the first supported protocol module. The broader direction includes anomalous perception, precognition, telepathy, REG/micro-PK, remote viewing, biofield/energy tracking, and future physical measurement protocols.

Future protocols should be able to reuse the same backbone:

- Precognition forced-choice
- REG / micro-PK binary line
- Async telepathy
- Remote viewing
- Energy/biofield tracking
- Telekinesis / macro-PK measurement

## Mindsight Session UX And Voice Roadmap

Tester feedback shows the active session experience needs clearer mode semantics and a more reliable voice-input architecture before expanding larger cloud features.

### Calibration And Test Mode Language

Training should be renamed to Calibration throughout the Mindsight session UI.

Intent:

- Calibration is used to tune/equalize color perception before actual testing.
- Calibration responses are not recorded as test data.
- Test responses are recorded.
- The UI should avoid casual-practice language that makes calibration feel like unstructured rehearsal.

Top-left mode display:

- Reuse and improve the existing top-left Test/Training tab or room indicator.
- Do not add a separate banner unless the existing mode area cannot carry the required information.
- Active Calibration display should read `Calibration`, with optional subtext `Responses not recorded`.
- Active Test display should read `Test`, with optional subtext `Responses recorded`.
- Increase mode text size, contrast, spacing, active-state styling, and small text size where needed.

Keyboard direction:

- Primary controls should be `A` / `D` to cycle and `Space` to confirm.
- Secondary controls should be `Ctrl` to toggle Calibration/Test and `Shift` to repeat current instructions.
- `Enter` should be removed or de-emphasized where it duplicates `Space`.
- `S` should be removed or de-emphasized if it only repeats the current color.

Spoken instruction direction:

- Entering Calibration should speak once: "Calibration. Use A or D to cycle through the colors. Responses are not recorded."
- Entering Test should speak once: "Test mode. Responses are recorded."
- Announcements must not loop.
- `Shift` should replay the current mode instructions once.
- A small spoken-instructions toggle is desirable if practical.
- Separate minimal room announcements from full spoken instructions where practical.

### Voice Provider Architecture

The current browser SpeechRecognition path can miss short leading words such as `red`, `blue`, `one`, `two`, and `six`. PsiLabs needs a provider abstraction so recognition paths can be swapped or compared without changing session command logic.

Current checkpoint:

- Browser Speech remains the baseline provider.
- Vosk Local is implemented through `vosk-browser` and lazy-loads its runtime when selected.
- Sherpa ONNX Local is implemented against the official browser WebAssembly ASR asset bundle.
- A standalone voice ASR diagnostic route exists at `#voice-asr-test`.
- Local model setup is documented in `docs/VOICE_ASR_LOCAL_MODELS.md`.
- These diagnostics are intentionally separable from the active TrainingRoom/CalibrationRoom UX changes.

Shared provider interface target:

```js
voiceProvider.start();
voiceProvider.stop();
voiceProvider.onResult(callback);
voiceProvider.onError(callback);
voiceProvider.isAvailable();
voiceProvider.cleanup();
voiceProvider.providerName;
```

Architecture direction:

- Session logic should consume a provider interface, not a concrete browser recognizer.
- Command interpretation should continue through the shared speech matcher/parser.
- Browser SpeechRecognition should become the first provider implementation.
- Provider support, errors, and active provider name should be easy to inspect.
- Open-source offline ASR should be tested before treating paid APIs as the default path.
- Do not target Picovoice/Rhino/Cheetah in the open-source-first provider plan.

Provider comparison targets:

- Browser Speech: existing Web Speech baseline, no raw-audio prebuffer.
- Vosk Local: offline browser ASR via `vosk-browser` WASM/WebWorker, optimized for short commands and constrained vocabulary.
- Sherpa ONNX Local: offline browser/local ASR using the official sherpa-onnx WebAssembly ASR bundle, preferably streaming, treated as the higher-quality open-source contender versus Vosk.
- Whisper API: paid/cloud comparison provider using captured audio clips and server-side credentials.
- Whisper Local: future desktop/local model provider, disabled or labeled coming soon until implemented.
- Voice Off: disables recognition while leaving keyboard controls intact.

Target command vocabulary:

- `red`
- `blue`
- `A`
- `D`
- `space`
- `submit`
- `calibration`
- `test`
- `results`

Shared prebuffer path:

```text
Browser mic
-> Web Audio API / MediaRecorder
-> rolling pre-buffer
-> captured audio clip
-> local ASR provider or /api/transcribe
-> transcript
-> shared command parser
```

Implementation notes:

- Start with an interface plus browser provider wrapper.
- Keep provider selection simple while making local providers visible for testing.
- Vosk Local expects a Vosk model archive at `public/models/vosk/model.tar.gz` or `VITE_VOSK_MODEL_URL`.
- Sherpa ONNX Local expects built WebAssembly ASR assets under `public/models/sherpa-onnx/` or `VITE_SHERPA_ONNX_ASSET_BASE_URL`.
- Add rolling pre-buffer capture before local/API transcription so direct one-word commands are not clipped at speech start.
- Use the same prebuffer utility for Vosk Local, Sherpa ONNX Local, Whisper API, and Whisper Local where possible.
- Add lightweight debug visibility for selected provider, listening status, raw transcript, normalized command, latency, confidence, and provider errors.
- Server-side Whisper API transcription requires an API route or function with protected credentials; this is one of the triggers for re-evaluating the app's server-backed architecture needs.

Open decisions:

- Whether local ASR providers should remain dev/test-only behind `VITE_ENABLE_LOCAL_ASR`.
- Whether Vosk's large lazy chunk is acceptable for production deployments.
- Whether Sherpa full ASR is worth its model/runtime footprint, or whether a Sherpa keyword-spotting path is a better long-term open-source local option.
- How, if at all, the diagnostic provider selector should later integrate into active session UX.

## Multi-Run Sessions And In-Progress Protection

Goal:

- Protect in-progress solo test data before leaving test phase.
- Allow multiple completed trial blocks under one broader session.

Current checkpoint:

- IndexedDB now provides a local sidecar persistence layer for solo sessions, with sessions marked `in_progress` or `completed`.
- Completed trials are saved immediately after finalization by `session_id` and `trial_index`, reducing data loss from refreshes or crashes.
- Google Sheets remains the end-of-session export/archive path rather than the real-time write path.

Planned model:

- Session:
  - `participantName`
  - `category`
  - `activeOptions`
  - `guessPolicy`
  - `deckPolicy`
  - `savedRuns`
- Run:
  - `runIndex`
  - `startedAt`
  - `endedAt`
  - `slots`
  - `results`
  - `trials`
  - `analytics`

Recommended order:

1. Add exit protection prompt for solo test phase.
2. Add `savedRuns` in-memory session structure.
3. Allow redo/new run to append to `savedRuns`.
4. Update results/export logic to support latest run vs all saved runs.
5. Later connect saved runs to Google Sheets append flow.

## History Graph System

Goal:

- Build a real history chart across saved sessions/runs, not only within one session.
- Add habit-tracking views that make practice consistency visible.

Desired controls:

- `1D`
- `1W`
- `1M`
- `3M`
- `6M`
- `1Y`
- `All`

Desired interactions:

- Drag-to-zoom.
- Double-click reset.
- Compact date x-axis labels.
- Avoid wasting empty time space.

Habit tracking ideas:

- Current session vs previous session comparison.
- Last 100 / 500 / 1000 cards vs previous equivalent window.
- Calendar heatmap showing practice days, volume, and streaks.
- Current streak and longest streak.
- Cards practiced in last 7 / 30 / 90 days.
- Protocol-aware comparisons once `protocol.label` and `protocol.tags` exist.

Implementation notes:

- Do not store streaks directly in the sheet/database.
- Compute streaks and rolling windows from saved trial/session history so filters can change the answer.
- Useful filters include `session.is_test`, `analysis.is_excluded`, `protocol.label`, `protocol.tags`, `protocol.response_mode`, `protocol.deck_policy`, and `context.input_method`.

Vertical dot-matrix overlay idea:

- Each card timestamp gets a target-colored vertical column.
- Guesses stack vertically within that column.
- Final guess sits in the target column.

Recommended order:

1. Normalize saved session timestamps.
2. Build reusable history graph data helpers.
3. Build rolling-window comparison helpers.
4. Add current-vs-previous session summary.
5. Add range presets and date-axis formatting.
6. Add calendar heatmap/streak view.
7. Add drag-to-zoom and double-click reset.
8. Prototype vertical per-card dot-matrix overlay.
9. Reuse graph system for solo and group participant views.

## Shared Sessions, Links, And Storage

Open questions:

- Should shared session codes remain local/deck-reconstruction codes, or become real cloud-linked sessions?
- Should shortened bitlink-style links point to encoded session config, Google Sheets-backed history, or database-backed sessions?
- Should shared sessions require Google Sheets, or should Google Sheets remain optional export/history storage?

Near-term recommendation:

- Keep shared session links independent from Google Sheets.
- A shared code/link should recreate session setup/deck without requiring Google auth.
- If Google Sheets is connected, it can save results, but should not be required to join or run a shared session.

Potential storage layers:

- Local memory: active run/session only.
- `localStorage`: small recovery snapshots and preferences.
- IndexedDB: local real-time trial persistence, offline history, larger session archives, audio/transcript drafts, cross-refresh persistence.
- Google Sheets: user-owned export/history table, good for transparency and analysis.
- Supabase or similar database: cross-device sync, scoreboards, shared sessions, auth, permissions, and multi-client workflows.

Future database-backed features:

- Cross-device sync.
- Phone-hosted target state while computer records responses.
- Cross-device camera capture for experimental rigs.
- Public or private scoreboard.
- Shared session rooms.
- Durable user accounts.
- Session ownership/permissions.
- Real-time updates between devices.
- Server-side short links.

Auth direction:

- Prefer passwordless accounts.
- Do not require an account for basic local-first use.
- Avoid building or storing passwords unless a future requirement clearly demands it.
- Support Google sign-in, email magic link / OTP, anonymous/local profiles that can be claimed later, and passkeys later if the app grows.
- Accounts should unlock cloud features, not block the core app.
- Keep auth provider assumptions swappable where practical.

Storage and retention principles:

- Supabase/database should be a mediator and recent-summary layer, not the permanent trial archive.
- Google Sheets should remain the durable long-term archive for full trial-level data.
- IndexedDB should hold local in-progress/completed session records, unsaved/interrupted work, and offline/retry queues.
- Supabase should hold only data needed for cloud UX.
- Full trial rows in Supabase should be temporary.
- Session summaries and scoreboard aggregates can persist longer than raw trial rows.
- Shared links/rooms should expire automatically, with a candidate TTL of 7-14 days unless links were used recently.
- Before cloud trial rows are scrubbed, prompt the user to save/archive to Google Sheets, export CSV, export JSON backup, or delete intentionally.

Archive reminders:

- Serious users should be nudged to connect Google Sheets or export CSV before temporary data is purged.
- The app should clearly distinguish durable archive, local-only save, pending sync/archive, and temporary cloud copy.
- Future UI should include an "Unsaved / Needs Review" area for interrupted sessions, completed but unarchived sessions, pending Google Sheets writes, and sessions marked for exclusion/review.
- Suggested Google Sheets archive rotation threshold: remind around 75,000 trial rows and strongly recommend a new archive around 100,000 trial rows.
- Consider creating separate trial archive spreadsheets while preserving the last X months or Y trials in the active history view for recent long-term analysis.

Suggested migration path:

1. Keep Google Sheets as optional user-owned export/history.
2. Done: add IndexedDB for real-time local session/trial persistence.
3. Add database backend only when cross-device sync, public scoreboards, or real shared rooms become active requirements.

## Shared Session Extensions

These are deferred extensions for shared sessions after the MVP realtime room wrapper exists. They should not be part of the initial shared-session implementation.

Analysis and comparison ideas:

- Public scoreboard or recent group sessions view.
- Median z-score, baseline comparison, or other shared-session aggregate views.
- Solo vs shared performance comparison.
- Participant profiles and cumulative participant stats.
- Import validation and profile correction systems for reconciling participant identity across CSV, Sheets, and cloud summaries.
- Double-blind modes or protocol variants.

Privacy and account ideas:

- Privacy settings for public, anonymous, private, or unlisted shared-session summaries.
- Participant profile claiming or correction flows.
- Long-term Supabase summary storage for shared-session summaries only, not full durable trial archives.
- Data retention policies for operational/shared-session cloud data, such as retaining only the last 1000 shared sessions or pruning expired rooms.

Infrastructure ideas:

- Next.js, Vercel, or another unified app layer only if shared sessions later need server-rendered pages, server-mediated room links, protected server logic, or a unified frontend/server deployment.
- Supabase should remain the data layer for shared-session summaries and realtime coordination unless a future requirement proves otherwise.
- CSV and Google Sheets remain the durable archive for participant-level trial data.

Advanced UI ideas:

- Dragging participant tiles or advanced room-layout controls.
- Zoom-like participant layouts for large shared sessions.
- Rich observer/presenter views beyond the basic leader dashboard.

## Leader Swatch / Participant State Perception

This is a deferred shared-session extension and is not part of the Shared Session MVP.

Design principle:

- Treat leader swatch perception as another protocol/run type, not a separate data universe.
- Reuse the existing dot-v1 schema skeleton as much as possible.
- Do not create a separate `leader_observation` namespace unless there is no cleaner generic mapping.
- Generic fields should remain reusable for any participant or protocol where they make sense.

Normal shared participant trial:

```text
protocol.type = forced_choice_perception
target.value = actual trial target
response.first_value = participant guess
score.is_hit = participant guessed target correctly
```

Leader participant-state perception trial:

```text
protocol.type = participant_state_perception
protocol.target_type = participant_swatch | participant_guess | participant_completion_state
participant.role = leader
target.value = actual participant swatch/state
response.first_value = leader's perceived swatch/state
score.is_hit = leader perceived participant state correctly
```

Minimal possible additions:

- `context.observed_participant_id`
- `context.observed_participant_name`
- `context.display_mode`

Optional later additions:

- `context.swatch_size`
- `context.tile_layout`

Analytics:

- Reuse `score.hit_rate`.
- Reuse `score.z`.
- Reuse `score.p_value`.
- Reuse `score.weighted_score`.
- Reuse `score.average_response_position`.

Future results UI may show separate sections:

- Participant target accuracy.
- Leader swatch/state perception accuracy.

## Telekinesis / Macro-PK Protocols

This is a later PsiLabs protocol family, after database-backed storage and cross-device sync exist.

Possible experiment types:

- Psi wheel rotation detection.
- Torsion rig movement detection.
- Electroscope movement/deflection tracking.
- Other camera-measurable macro-PK or environmental interaction setups.

Hardware/context assumptions:

- Requires external physical apparatus.
- Should include controlled-environment metadata, especially airtight/air-controlled container status.
- May use a phone camera mounted at the side/top of a clear container or hanging off a table edge.
- Desktop may serve as the main control/results device while phone acts as camera sensor.

Computer vision needs:

- Phone camera integration.
- OpenCV or similar tracking pipeline.
- Object/marker tracking for angular displacement, rotation rate, oscillation, or deflection.
- Calibration workflow for camera angle, scale reference, rig geometry, frame rate, baseline/no-participant drift, and environmental controls.

Potential generic schema fit:

- `protocol.type`: `macro_pk_motion_tracking`
- `protocol.phenomenon`: `telekinesis`
- `target.type`: `physical_rig`
- `response.data`: intention direction / effort interval / participant state
- `trial.data`: rig configuration and calibration references
- `score.data`: measured rotation, displacement, inferred force/power estimates
- `timing.*`: trial windows and event intervals
- `context.*`: environmental controls, container status, camera/device metadata

Possible measured outputs:

- Angular displacement
- Angular velocity
- Angular acceleration
- Deflection distance
- Oscillation amplitude
- Drift-corrected movement
- Inferred torque/force estimate
- Inferred power estimate
- Tracking confidence/quality score

Caution:

- Force/power estimates should be clearly marked as derived from calibration assumptions.
- Distinguish raw tracked movement from inferred physical quantities.
- Strong environmental metadata is required before comparing users or sessions.

## Precognition Suite

Precognition should be treated as a major PsiLabs module, not a single mini-game.

Goal:

- Build a reusable future-target experiment engine with multiple protocols using shared infrastructure.
- Build one future-target engine with many masks, not isolated mini-apps.

Shared engine pieces:

- Generic protocol schema
- Generic trial engine
- Target generation engine
- Timing / reveal engine
- Scoring engine
- Analytics engine

Example protocol config:

```json
{
  "phenomenon": "precognition",
  "type": "future_target_access",
  "target_type": "binary",
  "response_mode": "forced_choice",
  "rng_method": "crypto_rng",
  "reveal_delay_ms": 0,
  "time_window_ms": null,
  "score_method": "hit_rate"
}
```

Core dot-style fields:

```text
session.id
participant.id
protocol.id
session.started_at
session.ended_at
notes.session

trial.id
trial.session_id
trial.index
trial.started_at
timing.response_deadline_at
timing.reveal_at
trial.completed_at

target.value
target.generated_at
target.source
target.metadata

response.value
response.attempt_sequence
response.confidence
response.latency_ms
response.submitted_at

score.is_hit
score.hit_rate
score.z
score.p_value
score.weighted_score
score.timing_error_ms
```

Phase 1 priority experiments:

- Future Color Guess: user responds before future RNG reveal.
- Binary Future Guess: fast binary prediction such as `1/0`, `left/right`, or `up/down`.
- Time Window Sensing: event occurs in one of several future windows.

Phase 2 experiments:

- Presentiment Lite: subjective state response before future target reveal.
- Continuous REG / Micro-PK Line: continuous binary stream with influence, predict, or mixed modes.
- Delayed Feedback Precognition: response now, reveal later.

Phase 3 advanced experiments:

- Future Peak Detection.
- Associative Remote Viewing Lite.
- Session Timing Intuition.

Shared UI requirements:

- Choose protocol, target count, reveal speed, RNG method, notes, and tags.
- Support distraction-free session screens and countdowns where needed.
- Add optional confidence slider and optional voice input later.
- Show results by hit rate, z-score, rolling charts, time of day, tags, and protocol comparison.

RNG methods:

- `crypto_rng`
- `pseudo_rng`
- `qrng_api`
- `hardware_rng`

Analytics priority:

- Session stats
- Lifetime stats
- Last 100 trials
- Confidence correlation
- Time-of-day heatmap
- Tag correlation
- Protocol comparison

Recommended build order:

1. Future Color Guess
2. Binary Guess
3. Time Window Sensing
4. Presentiment Lite
5. REG Line
6. Delayed Reveal

Naming:

- Umbrella: `Precognition Suite`
- Sub-modes:
  - Future Guess
  - Time Window
  - Presentiment
  - REG Stream
  - Delayed Reveal
  - Peak Detection
